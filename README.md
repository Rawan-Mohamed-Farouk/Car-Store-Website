# Project Title: Simple Car Store Website

## Description
The Simple Car Store Website is a basic web application developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. The website showcases a selection of cars, each accompanied by a picture and brief details. When a user clicks on a car picture, additional details and the price are displayed, along with an option to add the car to the shopping cart. This project demonstrates a foundational understanding of web development, including front-end design, interactivity, and basic back-end data management.
